        <h2> HTML </h2>

        <ul>

            <li>
                
                enter your hTML notes right here, right now!!

                The first thing that I noticed about HTML, is that it is mainly divided of 2 components, the head, that basically

            tells the web browser what type of document we are working with, the site name, URL, etc., the second one is the body, which

            contains all the content that the end user is av to see when they go through the page

            </li>

            <li>
                
                The second most important thing that I learned, is that every peace of code, have it's opening and closing that,

                in this way, the computer knows how the fuck diferenciate what command is each one

                    these are the commands that I know so far about it:


                </li>

                <li>git status:checks what branch we are currently on</li>


                <li> git pull: it let us know if the branch is up to date with the server branch</li>


                <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

                <li>git commit -m "comment": confirm the changes we have done to the original code in our local machine</li>

                
              <li> git push: it sends the changes we have commited in our local workspace to the server branch</li>
