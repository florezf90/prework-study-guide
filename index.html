        <h2> HTML </h2>

        <ul>

            <li>
                
                The first thing that I noticed about HTML, is that it is mainly divided of 2 components, the head, that basically

            tells the web browser what type of document we are working with, the site name, URL, etc., the second one is the body, which

            contains all the content that the end user is av to see when they go through the page

            </li>

            <li>
                
                The second most important thing that I learned, is that every peace of code, have it's opening and closing that,

                in this way, the computer knows how the fuck diferenciate what command is each one

            <h2> CSS </h2>
            <ul>

                <li>There are 3 ways to style with CSS, Internal, external and inline CSS</li>

                <li> Inline CSS: apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style
                    
                    a particular page element only.
                
                </li>

                <li> Internal CSS: it's when we use a "style" element in the "head" section of the HTML file</li>

                <li>  External CSS: it's when we create a separate file to write our CSS code so it doesn't get mixed up with the HTML code</li> 
                
                <li> when we want to link an external css file to our HTML file, use the following command: "h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide"/h1" </li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    
                    these are the commands that I know so far about it:


                </li>

                <li>git status:checks what branch we are currently on</li>


                <li> git pull: it let us know if the branch is up to date with the server branch</li>


                <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>


                <li>git add -A: add to the branch the changes we have done to the code in VS</li>


                <li>git commit -m "comment": confirm the changes we have done to the original code in our local machine</li>

                
              <li> git push: it sends the changes we have commited in our local workspace to the server branch</li>
            </ul>

        <li> Control flow is the order in which the code is deployed</li>

        <li> A function is a block of code that allow us to perform certain taks, we need to 

            declare the funcntion, and then call it.
