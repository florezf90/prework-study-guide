# Prework Study Guide webpage
## Description


The prework Study guide was specifically designed to store comprehensive information on the topics covered, namely HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By establishing a dedicated repository, we guarantee that these notes will not be neglected on a mere piece of paper. Furthermore, they will be readily accessible to everyone, facilitating collaboration and enabling us to collectively contribute to each other's knowledge.
